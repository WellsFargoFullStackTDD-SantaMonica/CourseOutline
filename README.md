## Training Overview

Accelebrate's AngularJS / .NET / SQL Server Test Driven Development course prepares students to use test first development methodologies in their coding workflow.  This includes unit tests, using Isolation & Mocking frameworks, and Dependency Injection / Inversion of Control containers.  The course will apply these concepts in a SQL Server / .NET / ASP.NET MVC WebAPI / AngularJS application development environment.  Different tools, frameworks, and APIs such as nUnit, Microsoft's Fakes, NSubstitute, Typemock, Microsoft's Unity, Ninject, QUnit, Karma, Jasmine, and Mocha will be discussed, compared, and applied.  Concepts and tools for Continuous Integration / Delivery / Deployment will also be covered.

## Training Prerequisites

.NET and JavaScript programming experience.

## Hands-on/Lecture Ratio

This course is 40% lecture/demo and 60% lab.

## Training Materials

Due to the highly customized nature of this course, students will receive a variety of reference materials such as books, courseware, and electronic curriculum.
